# About

Hi, I'm Canaris.	

I'm a web developer amongst other things, thought I usually work React, Svelte, Astro and the like, I've been doing a decent amount of Go and Rust lately. I'm also experienced with Python, and have used C++ on a nonrecurring basis.

Some games I play are Honkai Star Rail and War Thunder, with one of my favourite games being Helldivers 2.
