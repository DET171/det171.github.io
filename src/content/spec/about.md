# About

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Canaris.	

I'm a web developer amongst other things, and usually work with React, Svelte, Astro and the like. I've also been doing a decent amount of Go and Rust lately. I'm also experienced with Python, and have used C++ here and there.

Some games I play are Honkai Star Rail and War Thunder, with one of my favourite games being Helldivers 2.
I do follow CS Esports, and am a pretty big fan of m0NESY and NiKo (professional major choker).

I'm also pretty proud of having contributed to Astro (it was a pretty minor bugfix but I use it as flexing rights on my friends sometimes).
