_Ignore the Feixiao pic, it just looks nice._

Anyways. I'll be frank, I am quite the lazy person. Min-maxxing life is kinda just my thing (money included), so naturally, I use something called [ReVanced](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-manager). For the uninformed, it is essentially a tool that allows you to patch applications, such as YouTube Music, to remove ads, add features, etc. 

So, basically a successor to the now-defunct YouTube Vanced.
