Many have considered the rise of Artificial Intelligence the past few years as highly unprecedented. The world evolved along with it, albeit at times with ever so slight amounts of resistance. The judiciary, has however, historically been one of the branches of the government most resistant to any form of rapid technological innovations. Most notably, it took the US Federal Judiciary more than two decades to widely adopt electronic filing (e-filing) systems. The Case Management/Electronic Case Files (CM/ECF) system was introduced in the 1990s, but by 2002, only 11 of the 94 District Courts had adopted such systems. It was not until 2007 that nearly all federal courts adopted e-filing systems, and 2014 that the Supreme Court's finally became fully operational.

The judiciary has to, along with the other two branches of the government, adapt to the rapid technological advancements of the 21st century. It cannot afford to remain stagnant, for doing so will only render it unable to keep up with issues that arise from the ever-evolving modern world. As Chief Justice John Roberts noted in his 2023 year end report, "[t]hese tools have the welcome potential to smooth out any mismatch between available resources and urgent needs in our court system".

"Law professors report with both awe and angst that AI apparently can earn Bs on law school assignments and even pass the bar exam," Roberts wrote. "Legal research may soon be unimaginable without it. A.I. obviously has great potential to dramatically increase access to key information for lawyers and nonlawyers alike."

Indeed, the potential of AI in the judiciary is vast, and the Courts should not be slow to catch up with such technological advancements. "Many AI applications Indisputably assist the judicial system in advancing [the 'just, speedy, and inexpensive' resolution of cases]", Roberts again opined.

It is thus argued that AI has, undeniably, a role in the future of the justice system. While direct arbitration by AI in larger trial court cases may not yet transpire so soon in the near future, it can still nevertheless be used to assist or augment the work of judges and lawyers. AI, for instance, can be used to replace judges in more mundane tasks such as the issuing of certain orders or warrants, or perhaps drafting of shorter and less complex opinions for less complex and more routine rulings which do not require extensive legal analysis. This would however be only limited to proceedings in lower trial courts, as appellate courts rulings usually involve deciding whether a lower court has abused its discretion or misapplied the law. AI inherently lacks the ability to make such determinations as it is largely based on existing information, and is incapable of applying such information in cases where no relevant precedent exists.

It is also suggested that an AI can be vested with curbed powers similar to that of a Article I tribunal (_U.S.C.A. Const. Art. I, § 8, cl. 9_), an inferior court that is created by Congress under Article I of the Constitution. These courts are not considered Article III courts, and are thus not vested with the full judicial power of the United States. They are limited to hearing cases that arise under the powers granted to Congress, or in the case of magistrate judges, to hear certain pretrial matters and issue warrants amongst a slew of other duties.

An AI could be vested with similar powers, and could be used to assist in the resolution of certain cases that do not require the full attention of a judge. This would free up judges to focus on more complex cases, and would also help to greatly reduce the backlog of cases that many courts face.

For instance, an AI arbitrator could be empowered to preside over cases involving petty offences or misdemeanors, uncontested divorce proceedings or perhaps even civil cases where the amount in controversy is below a certain threshold. This would greatly reduce the burden on the courts, and would also help to ensure that cases are resolved in a timely manner. The AI could be programmed to follow a set of guidelines or rules, and could be used to issue decisions in cases where the facts are not hotly disputed and the law is relatively clear.

An AI could also be used to preside over certain other civil cases where both parties consent, or where the parties agree to be bound by the decision of the AI.

These decisions, however, coming from an inferior "officer" or court, would still ultimately be subject to review by an Article III court as seen in _United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667 (1980)_, where the Supreme Court held that the "ultimate decision" is reserved for the district court judge and that magistrates "are constantly subject to the court’s control". In _Mathews v. Weber, 423 U.S. 261 (1976)_, the Court also observed that "[magistrates] helps the court focus on the relevant portions of what might be a voluminous record and move directly to any substantial legal arguments by putting before the court a preliminary evaluation of the evidence in the record", and though "substantially assisting the court", "the authority—and the responsibility—to make informed, final determination... remains with the judge."

An AI could be limited in similar ways to an Article I tribunal where its jurisdiction is limited, and while capable of issuing decisions, it would still be subject to review by a higher court or officer like the district judge (de novo if necessary). These decisions would of course also then be eligible for appeal to a Circuit Court of Appeals, and ultimately the Supreme Court if necessary and certiorari is granted. This would ensure that the AI does not overstep its bounds and that the ultimate decision still lies with a human judge, reducing any potential grievances that may arise from the allegations of bias or unfairness from an algorithm.
