			Hi, Iâ€™m Canaris. I'm currently a high school student, and I enjoy programming, specifically
			web and app development, and gaming. I'm also interested in cybersecurity and ethical hacking.

			<br /><br />

			I also watch TV shows and movies from time to time, and a few favourites of mine are Suits and
			The Clone Wars.
